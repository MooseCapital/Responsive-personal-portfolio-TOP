This project is in TheOdinProject curiculum. It is for testing my new knowledge about responsiveness in the 
web page. Where previously I had used width on everything. Now I use max-width, along with media queries to 
have a specific style for each device width.
```css
@media (max-width: 570px) {
    :root {
        font-size: 16px;
    }
}
```
